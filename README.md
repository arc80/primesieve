A sample application using [Plywood](https://plywood.arc80.com/).

This application prints all the prime numbers that fit in a 32-bit integer (up to 4294967296) using a [segmented prime sieve algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Segmented_sieve).

See the [Plywood documentation](https://plywood.arc80.com/docs/Developing/NewRepos) for instructions on how to download, build and run it.
